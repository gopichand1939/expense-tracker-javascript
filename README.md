# 💸 Expense Tracker - JavaScript Project

This is a simple **Expense Tracker application** that I built using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** (no frameworks). It allows you to add expenses with a name and amount, shows a total, and saves everything using localStorage — so the data stays even after refreshing the page.

## ✅ What I Learned
- How to work with DOM elements using JavaScript
- Handling form inputs and validations
- Using arrays and loops to display data
- Storing and retrieving data using `localStorage`
- Deploying a project using GitHub Pages

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- GitHub Pages (for deployment)

## 📦 How to Clone & Run the Project Locally

1. Open terminal or PowerShell and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gopichand1939/expense-tracker-javascript.git
cd expense-tracker-javascript
````

2. To run the app, just open `index.html` in any browser:

```bash

Or, if you're using VS Code:

* Open folder in VS Code
* Right-click `index.html` → Click `Open with Live Server`

## 🚀 How I Deployed It

I hosted it using GitHub Pages:

* Go to repo → Settings → Pages
* Set **branch** to `main` and **folder** to `/root`
* GitHub gives a live link like this:
